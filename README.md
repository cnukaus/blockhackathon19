## Judging Criteria 


Is it a Layer 1 solution

Is your solution is implemented at the base-level protocol of ethereum itself and can be referred to as Layer 1 scaling solution? Or if it improves the existing Layer 1 scaling solutions such as Sharding, PoS or Clients 

Is it a Layer 2 solution

Is your solution is implemented “on top of” the ethereum main-chain and can be referred to as an "off-chain" or Layer 2 solution and improves ethereum scalability? Or does it improve the existing Layer 2 solutions, such as Plasma, Channel, Snark, etc?
